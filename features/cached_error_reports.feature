Feature: Cached Error Reports

Scenario: If an empty file is in the cache directory then zero requests should be made
    When I run "EmptyReportScenario" and relaunch the app
    And I configure the app to run in the "non-crashy" state
    And I run "EmptyReportScenario"
    Then I should receive no requests
